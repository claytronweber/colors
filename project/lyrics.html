                        bettering ourselves through selfish minds.
                        it has started to overflow.

                    Enclosed in a space of soothing sounds.
                    Walking in my own movie...
                    The fly by with no remembrance.
                    Constant rushing...
                    The waves have pushed me to where I need to be.

                    Only the sounds of what my mind wants to hear.
                    Block out the rush hour...
                    block out the tired herds...

                    On the shaded side, it’s starting to affect the process of your reading eyes.
                    An aggressive need for a hostile voice is creeping away...
                    this block happens every year...
                    and like I said before the color keeps fading.

                    I couldn’t trade this for anything in the world...
                    This block happens every year...
                    And all of you are the reason.
                    This block happens every year...
                    It’s been a while since we’ve written each other and hopefully this will comfort you.
                    ‘Cause like most of my kind, I won’t take it all for granted.
                    I will just keep waiting...you will just keep waiting.

                    The journey begins... forcing a new life with the unexplained...
                    A creeping rush that surrounds me.
                    Floating away.
                    Floating away.
                    Floating away.

                    Unexpected... not knowing why.
                    Now knowing why.
                    Wonder why I question it now?
                    I’m my own planet...
                    Not many can experience this sensation.
                    Loneliness is creeping out...
                    Or in, however you think of it.
                    But it sure is surrounding me.
                    Maybe all the complaining is an occurrence of boredom.
                    I suppose it’s too late.
                    I am floating farther.
                    I am floating farther and farther away.
                    I am floating farther.
                    I am floating.

                    Planets everywhere... my own destiny...
                    I’m floating towards the sun, the sun of nothing.
                    Floating towards the sun, the sun of nothing.
                    I have become the sun of nothing.
                    Nothing is here.
                    Memories are not clear.
                    I’m floating towards the sun, the sun of nothing.
                    Floating towards the sun, the sun of nothing.
                    Floating, floating, floating to the sun... farther away.
                    I can’t believe that’s what it has come to...
                    I never really had it all that bad.
                    I just looked around and never thought about the blank stares.
                    Blank stares.
                    They were looking into something much worse than what I thought I was.
                    Selfishness is a very sticky quality of this species.
                    Looking around... I don’t see any faces...
                    Yes, I am lonely.
                    It’s to be expected.

                    I’ve been told, I’ve been told, I’ve been told that I have been grinding them like gears during my dream hours...

                    One which parts with the night, the night.
                    I saw them dragging the other day, other day.
                    Scraping their knees...
                    Seems the high horse is taking them all home...
                    I can’t leave myself out.
                    Seems the high horse is taking them all home...
                    I can’t leave myself out, self out.
                    Why should we sleep today...
                    Why should we awake tomorrow?
                    We can just pop back a few and drift through this pre-programmed flight.
                    We can just pop back a few and drift through this pre-programmed flight.
                    Across all oceans... a windy, noisy trek...
                    Across all oceans... a windy, noisy trek...
                    This seems to be what I’ve needed.
                    Across all oceans... a windy, noisy trek...
                    Across all oceans...a windy, noisy trek...
                    The view used to be better...lands are growing into one.
                    We wanted it this way.
                    We were brought up to grow into one.
                    We were brought up to grow into one.
                    I’m going to fly up soon and seek other lands.
                    The soothing air of flight...
                    A bird’s eye view into what I’ve always imagined life could be.
                    Will it be sought after?
                    It might just be useless writing and ideas that laziness will corrupt in the end.
                    Bones of dust need hardening.
                    I think the prescription.
                    I think the prescription is found.
                    Sleep on...
                    Sleep on... fly on.
                    In your mind, you can fly.
                    Sleep on...
                    Sleep on... fly on.
                    In your mind, you can fly.
                    Sleep on...
                    Sleep on... fly on.
                    In your mind, you can fly.
                    Sleep on...
                    Sleep on...fly on.
                    In your mind, you can fly.

                    My teeth grin oddly today...
                    They seem to gleam more than normal.
                    Maybe it will be noticed.
                    Walking dead.

                    The headless lover of three...
                    an unspeakable affair...
                    The lady on the hill creates a glorious departure from her everyday, her everyday life.
                    Constant swelling of the ankles...
                    A pleasant cry for help...
                    A pleasant cry for help...
                    A pleasant cry for help...
                    She began to unfold her story.
                    A grieving widow mothered this headless wonder.
                    A perfect crime, that soon lived on.
                    A different life it had to develop...
                    Gripped by every limb it could hold, the lifeless ideas, it grew onto its own.
                    A much needed surrender.
                    Trees soon started to grow from what seemed a lifeless neck...
                    From a monster to a beauty in quick months...
                    its life seemed to be on its way to a rare freedom.
                    It decided it should take advantage, advantage of this idea, of this idea.
                    A mixture of plantings soon took course in its body...
                    A spectacle none-the-less.
                    Walking proud through life, letting its branches guide the way.
                    A path which seemed to be covered in sunshine...
                    It must be human, for its qualities seem to outdo even the grandest occupant of the town...
                    This started to catch the attention of the un-branched...
                    It had never experienced an affection of this kind...
                    A wonderful and frightening new obstacle in its life.
                    this started to catch the attention of the un-branched...
                    it had never experienced an affection of this kind...
                    a wonderful and frightening new obstacle in its life.
                    Years went by as it finally found true love...
                    the love of others...three to be exact.
                    Letting them into every secret...feeding from every branch...
                    every part used for their lives...
                    It noticed its walking seemed more staggered than normal.
                    The breeze didn’t flow like it used to...
                    the heart seemed to pound slower and slower...
                    what caused this?
                    What caused this?
                    It soon was noticed that these three had torn every branch, every single stem...
                    torn to its last life...
                    How hadn’t it noticed a drastic change in the surroundings...
                    It didn’t think anything could go this wrong.
                    “Comfort.”
                    “Comfort.”
                    “Comfort.”

                    “Comfort.”
                    It thought life was constant.
                    Happiness, if constant happiness was all that was given out.

                    hints and all, they did as they pleased...
                    And now it’s starting to wilt away.
